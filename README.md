## Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification

## Overview
This is the repo for my first task at the ML Virtual Internship from [Prodigy InfoTech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodigy-infotech/). This project involves building a machine learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of 25,000 images, achieving a good accuracy on the validation set.

## Key Features
- Data Exploration: There were two folders of images (One for training with 25000 images ansd another one for testing images with 12500 ones).
- Data Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values, and split the data into training and validation sets.
- Model Training: The model is trained using an ImageDataGenerator with data augmentation for the training set.
- Model Evaluation: Displaying model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Implemented Keras Tuner for optimizing the model's architecture, resulting in improved performance.
- Data Augmentation: Utilized data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- Best Model Selection: Employed early stopping and model checkpointing to select the best-performing model.
- Predicting the test images.
